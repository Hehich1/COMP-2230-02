# COMP 2230 – Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis
## Lab: Searching Algorithms in Java

### Instructor: Shivani Tyagi

---

## Lab Objective
In this lab, students will implement and analyze two searching algorithms:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

Students will compare the number of comparisons and execution time for each algorithm and understand how algorithm efficiency changes with larger datasets.

---

## Activities

### 1. Implement Linear Search
- Write a method `linearSearch(int[] arr, int target)` that searches for a target value in an array.
- Return the index of the element if found; otherwise, return -1.

### 2. Implement Binary Search
- Write a method `binarySearch(int[] arr, int target)` that searches a **sorted** array.
- Return the index of the element if found; otherwise, return -1.
- Ensure the array is sorted before calling this method.

### 3. Compare the Algorithms
- Create an array of integers.
- Search for a number using both Linear and Binary Search.
- Count the number of comparisons.
- Measure execution time using `System.nanoTime()`.

---

## Discussion Questions
1. Which algorithm required more comparisons?
2. Why must Binary Search use a sorted array?
3. What happens if the array size increases to 1,000,000?
4. Which algorithm would you choose for very large datasets?

---

## Submission
- Implement all methods in the provided Java file `SearchLab.java`.
- Test your methods using the `main` method.
- Submit the completed Java file by the end of the lab session.
